questions:
- "How do I track the changes I make to files using Git?"
objectives:
- "Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for one or more files."
- "Describe where changes are stored at each stage in the modify-add-commit cycle."
keypoints:
- "`git status` shows the status of a repository."
- "Files can be stored in a projectâ€™s working directory (which users see), the staging area (where the next commit is being built up) and the local repository (where commits are permanently recorded)."
- "`git add` puts files in the staging area."
- "`git commit` saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository."
- "Write commit messages that accurately describe your changes."
- "`git log` lists the commits made to the local repository."

### Add to Version Control

![Tracking changes to files](fig/slides/04-changes/1_key.png){:width="20%"}

We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

~~~
$ git add climate_analysis.py temp_conversion.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

and then check that the right thing happened:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   climate_analysis.py
        new file:   temp_conversion.py
~~~
{: .output}

Git now knows that it's supposed to **keep track** of `climate_analysis.py` and `temp_conversion.py`,
but it **hasn't recorded these changes as a commit** yet:

### Initial Commit
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Initial commit of climate analysis code"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We use the `-m` flag (for "**message**")
to record a short, **descriptive comment** that will help us remember later on what we did and why.

If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured at the start)
so that we can write a longer message.

**Good commit messages** start with a brief (<50 characters) summary of
changes made in the commit.

**NOT "Bug Fixes"** or **"Changes"**!

If you want to go into more detail, add
a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.

~~~
[master (root-commit) a10bd8f] Initial commit of climate analysis code
 2 files changed, 50 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 climate_analysis.py
 create mode 100644 temp_conversion.py
~~~
{: .output}

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a **[revision](reference.html#revision)**
and its short **identifier** is `a10bd8f`.
(Your revision will have different identifier.)


If we run `git status` now:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~
{: .output}

it tells us everything is up to date.

![Add and Commit](fig/slides/04-changes/2_adding.png){:width="20%"}

Git has a special **staging** area
where it keeps track of things that have been **added** to
the current [change set](reference.html#change-set)
but **not yet committed**.
`git add` puts things in this area,
and `git commit` then copies them to long-term storage (as a commit)

### Review the Log

![Exploring history #1](fig/slides/04-changes/3_history.png){:width="20%"}

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the **project's history** using `git log`:

~~~
$ git log
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
commit a10bd8f6192f9ab29b1821d7d7929fbf6484686a
Author: John R <j.robinson@software.ac.uk>
Date:   Mon Dec 7 14:13:32 2015 +0000

    Initial commit of climate analysis code
~~~
{: .output}

`git log` lists all **revisions committed** to a repository in reverse chronological order (most recent at the top).

The listing for each revision includes

* the **revision's full identifier** (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
* the revision's **author**,
* **when** it was created,
* the **log message** Git was given when the revision was committed.

> ## Where Are My Changes?
>
> If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just our original files called `climate_analysis.py` and `temp_conversion.py`.
> That's because Git saves information about files' history
> in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier
> so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
> (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).
{: .callout}

### Modify a file (1)
Now suppose we add more information, a **Docstring**, to the **top** of one of the files:

~~~
$ nano climate_analysis.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
""" Climate Analysis Tools """
~~~
{: .output}

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

		modified:   climate_analysis.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to **commit**".


So, while we have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
much less actually saved them (which we do with `git commit`).

**It's important to remember that git only stores changes when you make a commit**

### Review Changes and Commit
It is good practice to always **review
our changes** before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently commited version:

~~~
$ git diff
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git a/climate_analysis.py b/climate_analysis.py
index 277d6c7..d5b442d 100644
--- a/climate_analysis.py
+++ b/climate_analysis.py
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
+""" Climate Analysis Tools """
import sys
import temp_conversion
import signal
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Windows users note
>
> **No newline at end of file**
> This message is displayed because otherwise there is no way to tell the difference between a file where there is a newline at the end and one where is not. Diff has to output a newline anyway, or the result would be harder to read or process automatically.
> This can safely be ignored, but you can avoid seeing it by leaving a blank line at the end of your file.
{: .callout}


The output is **cryptic** because
it is actually a series of **commands** for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how **to reconstruct one file given the other**.

The key things to note are:

 1. Line 1: The **files** that are being **compared** (a/ and b/ are labels, not paths)
 2. Line 2: The two **hex strings** on the second line which parts of the **hashes** of the files being compares
 3. Line 5: The **lines** that have changed. (It's complex)
 4. Below that, the changes - note the '**+**' marker which shows an addtion


After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Add Docstring"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified:   climate_analysis.py

no changes added to commit
~~~
{: .output}

**Whoops**:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

~~~
$ git add climate_analysis.py
$ git commit -m "Add Docstring"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[master 6077ba7] Add Docstring
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

** Recapping add / commit**

Git insists that we **add** files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything
because we may not want to commit **everything at once**.

For example,
suppose we might have **fixed a bug** in some existing code, but we might have added new code that's **not ready to share**



### One more addition

![Differences](fig/slides/04-changes/4_differences.png){:width="20%"}

Let's add another line to the end of the file:

~~~
$ nano climate_analysis.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# TODO(js-robinson): Add call to process rainfall
~~~
{: .output}

Check what's changed with **diff**:

~~~
$ git diff
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git a/climate_analysis.py b/climate_analysis.py
index d5b442d..c463f71 100644

+
+# TODO(js-robinson): Add call to process rainfall
~~~

So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).

Now let's put that change in the staging area (or **add it to the change set**)
and see what `git diff` reports:

~~~
$ git add climate_analysis.py
$ git diff
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
~~~
{: .output}

**There is no output**:

**git diff** shows us the differences between the **working copy** and what's been added to the **change set** in staging area.

However, if we do this:

~~~
$ git diff --staged
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`).
