## 0. Introduction


### Before We Start

- Make sure you have an account at [github.com](https://www.github.com)
- Go to, or make, a `climate-analysis` repo
- Open VS Code or a text editor
- e.g. Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++, BBEdit


## 1. What Is Academic Software?


### The Large

- Database creation & management
- HPC simulation codes
- Machine learning pipelines
- OSes & drivers


### The Small

- Collections of scripts
- Cleaning data
- Plotting figures
- Toy models


### The Commonalities

- May not be true for Engineering/CompSci!
- *Instrumental*- not a goal in itself
- *Experimental*- may not have a clear spec
- Small teams


### The Issues

- **Paperware**
- Unplanned
- Undocumented
- Unmaintainable
- Can't onboard people
- Disposable


### Serious Problems

- Software Is Science
- Reproducibility
- Wasted effort
- Harms collaboration


## 2. How Do We Avoid This


### Forward-thinking

- Assume people will try to understand
- Assume people will try to reproduce
- Make it as easy as possible


### Understanding

- Write clear code
- Document your code
- Document your *development process*
- Document your code's limitations


### Reproducibility

- Track versions of your code
- Specify versions used in your papers
- Cite your code
